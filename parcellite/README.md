# Parcellite

My configuration file for the [Parcellite](http://parcellite.sourceforge.net/)
clipboard manager.

> [!WARNING]
> On 2025-10-26, I switched to [CopyQ](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ) due to
> various issues with Parcellite (stopped working after a system update, seems
> to generally unmaintained), so my Parcellite configuration is no longer
> actively maintained.

## Installation

* Copy `parcelliterc` to `$HOME/.config/parcellite/`.
